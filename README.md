Project code 1- Resilience analysis
Global resilience anlaysis of crop yields. Merge different data types together and analyze relationship between yield shocks and determinants(disasters, conflicts, and agri-related variables). Use ML to identify most dominating independent variables

Project code 2- Weather impacts using climate data
Estimate weather impacts (non-linear) on crop yields using different models. Control for time-invariant factors.

Project code 3- Crop modelling and EVT analysis
Use Infocrop to batch process and simulate gridded crop yields. Use the simulated yields for extreme value analysis (tail-ends distribution of crop yields for risk analysis). Finally, use the simulated yields to calculate insurance indicators.
